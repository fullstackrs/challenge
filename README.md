**Challenge:  Building a Blog with Supabase**

Create a simple blog application with two main components: a blog list for public viewing and an admin panel for managing blogs using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase.

**Features:**

1. **Blog List:**
   - Display a list of blogs with their titles, authors, and publication dates.
   - Each blog item should link to a detailed view of the blog post.

2. **Blog Detail Page:**
   - Show the full content of the selected blog.
   - Include information such as the title, author, publication date, and the blog post content.

3. **Admin Panel:**
   - Authentication: Use Supabase Auth for authentication.
   - Only authenticated users should have access to the admin panel.
   - Admins should be able to create, edit, and delete blog posts.
   - Each blog post in the admin panel should have title, author, and content fields.

4. **User Authentication:**
   - Users should be able to sign up and log in using Supabase Auth.
   - Implement a private route for the admin panel that requires authentication.
   - Use Supabase Auth to manage user sessions.

5. **Styling:**
   - Use Tailwind CSS to style your components.
   - Design a responsive layout for the public blog list and the admin panel.

**Technical Requirements:**

1. **Frontend:**
   - Use Next.js to build the front end.
   - Integrate Tailwind CSS for styling.
   - Utilize React components for modularity and reusability.
   - Handle routing for blog list, blog detail, and the admin panel.

2. **Backend:**
   - Use Supabase for data storage.
   - Leverage Supabase Auth for user authentication.

3. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the application to a hosting platform of your choice (Vercel, Netlify, etc.).
   - Include the deployment URL in your submission.

**Submission Guidelines:**

1. **Code Repository:**
   - Email the link to your GitHub repository containing the project's code.

2. **Instructions:**
   - Include a README file with instructions on how to set up and run the project.

3. **Demo:**
   - Provide a live demo link (if applicable) via email.

**Bonus Points (Optional):**

  - Design an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface for the public blog list and the admin panel.
  - Pay attention to layout, color schemes, typography, and overall visual appeal.
  - Ensure a responsive design that looks good on various screen sizes and devices.
